					<h2>Old Town</h2>

						<p>This is perhaps the busiest destination, being for most tourists their first port of call; however, there are masses of things to see and do, making it well worth your time to battle through the crowds.</p>

						<p>Museo de la Revolución – very interesting to visit but be careful to take the ‘facts’ presented with a pinch of salt (and remember to bring a dictionary as a lot of the signs are in Spanish only!)</p>

						<p>El Floridita – have your photo taken with (a statue of) Ernest Hemmingway in his favourite café!  You will find a few other places also claiming this status but we are pretty sure he did actually visit this cafe, unlike many of those that claim the same!</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
				
					<h2>New Town</h2>

						<p>Fábrica de Arte Cubano – very cool art gallery transforming into a very cool club by night and filled with locals and tourists alike</p>

						<p>Plaza de la Revolución  - home to the enormous memorial to José Martí that overlooks the city and is often one of the first things you will drive past when entering the city from the direction of the airport</p>

					<h2>Salsa</h2>

						<p>Situated the in main town square, Vinales' dance school provides fun, one on one, intimate salsa classes for all ages and abilities. Rock up and book on the spot, for an experiecne you will not forget!</p>

						<p>After learning Salsa the 'local way' you can pop to the Salsa bar next door, which is well worth a visit! Grab a drink and a partner and show them your moves!</p>

				</div>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
		
					<h2>Horse Riding</h2>

						<p>This is the highlight of Vinales, a great day out and afforable trip for everyone! Hop on a horse and take a ride through the unforgetable countryside Vinales has to offer.</p>

						<p>This adventure will lead you through Cubas Tabaccos plantations, witnessing their unchanged and traditional agricultural methods. Hand rolled cigars and natural fruit juices will await you, before continuing the ride to discover underground caves and rivers to be explored.</p>
