					<h2>Old Town</h2>

						<p>This is perhaps the busiest destination, being for most tourists their first port of call; however, there are masses of things to see and do, making it well worth your time to battle through the crowds.</p>

						<p><b>Museo de la Revolución</b> – very interesting to visit but be careful to take the ‘facts’ presented with a pinch of salt (and remember to bring a dictionary as a lot of the signs are in Spanish only!)</p>

						<p><b>El Floridita</b> – have your photo taken with (a statue of) Ernest Hemmingway in his favourite café!  You will find a few other places also claiming this status but we are pretty sure he did actually visit this cafe, unlike many of those that claim the same!</p> 

				</div>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

					<h2>New Town</h2>

						<p><b>Fábrica de Arte Cubano</b> – very cool art gallery transforming into a very cool club by night and filled with locals and tourists alike</p>

						<p><b>Plaza de la Revolución</b>  - home to the enormous memorial to José Martí that overlooks the city and is often one of the first things you will drive past when entering the city from the direction of the airport</p>

					<h2>Salsa</h2>

						<p>Situated the in main town square, <b>Vinales' dance school</b> provides fun, one on one, intimate salsa classes for all ages and abilities. Rock up and book on the spot, for an experiecne you will not forget!</p>

						<p>After learning Salsa the 'local way' you can pop to the <b>Salsa bar</b> next door, which is well worth a visit! Grab a drink and a partner and show them your moves!</p>

				</div>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
		
					<h2>Horse Riding</h2>

						<p>This is the highlight of Vinales, a great day out and afforable trip for everyone! Hop on a <b>horse</b> and take a ride through the unforgetable countryside Vinales has to offer.</p>

						<p>This adventure will lead you through Cuba's <b>tabacco plantations</b>, witnessing their unchanged and traditional agricultural methods. Hand rolled cigars and natural fruit juices will await you, before continuing the ride to discover and explore underground caves and rivers. </p>

					<h2>Beach</h2>

						<p>Just 15 minutes from the city center, <b>Playa Ancon</b> is one of the prettiest beaches on the south coast of cuba. Hop on the bus and take a day away from the crowds to swim in the aqua blue sea!</p>

						<p>If you are looking to escape the other tourist, take a short stay in <b>La Boca</b>, another beach area (near the top of the peninsula) providing much more interaction with the locals.</p>

						<p>For a fun day out, why not rent <b>bikes</b> to explore the area. In addition, just a short <b>boat ride</b> away from Playa Ancon, visitors can dive and snorkel the largest balck coral reef in Cuba!</p>

				</div>

				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">

					<h2>Town</h2>

						<p>The picturesque <b>Plaza Mayor</b> lies in the historical center. Surrounded by cafes and restaurants, its an evocative spot to pull up a seat and admire the cobbled streets and beautiful colonial buildings.</p>

						<p>The famous, <b>Museo Historico Municipal</b> and <b>Iglesia Parroquial de la Santisima Trinidad</b> are both arichtectual gems you dont want to miss. After browsing the museum, make sure to ascent the steep spiral stairs of the tower for <b>panoramic views</b> of the city, Caribbean sea and unforgettable sunsets!</p>

						<p>Don't miss out on a fantastic night at <b>Las Cuevas</b> just up the hill from Plaza Mayor. This nightclub is in a natural cave, full of locals and tourists alike. With cheap drinks and great music, you'll be out until the sun comes up.</p>
